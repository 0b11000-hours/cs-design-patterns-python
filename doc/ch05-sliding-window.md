# Sliding Window Patterns

The sliding window pattern is used to solve problems that require finding a subset of elements in an array that satisfy
a certain condition. The pattern is based on the idea of maintaining a window of elements in the array and moving the
window based on the condition being satisfied or not. The sliding window pattern is useful for solving problems that
involve finding subarrays, substrings, or subsequences that satisfy a certain condition.
